## Loops

Let's say we have an array of items called files. Files contains a list of files that are in our working directory. How would we do an operation on each file? One way to do this is to use a for loop.

For loops do something over and over again until some criteria is reached.

There are two main ways to write for loops in bash (and in most programming languages). The first is a called a traditional or C-style for loop. It is a little tricky to explain.


### A traditional, C-style for loop

Traditional C-style for loops have the following general format:
for (INITIALIZATION; CONDITION; AFTERTHOUGHT) 
{
    // Code for the for-loop's body goes here.
}






### for loop -- python style

### while loop

## Flow control

### If

### Elsif

### Else
